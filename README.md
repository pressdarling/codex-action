# Codex GitHub Action

Run [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex#codex-exec) from a GitHub Actions workflow while keeping tight control over the privileges available to Codex. This action handles installing the Codex CLI and configuring it with a secure proxy to the [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses).

Users must provide an API key for their chosen provider (for example, [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` [if using Azure for OpenAI models](#azure)) as a [GitHub Actions secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets) to use this action.

## Example: Create Your Own Pull Request Bot

While Codex cloud offers a [powerful code review tool](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud/code-review) that you can use today, here is an example of how you can build your own code review workflow with `openai/codex-action` if you want to have more control over the experience.

In the following example, we define a workflow that is triggered whenever a user creates a pull request that:

- Creates a shallow clone of the repo.
- Ensures the `base` and `head` refs for the PR are available locally.
- Runs Codex with a `prompt` that includes the details specific to the PR.
- Takes the output from Codex and posts it as a comment on the PR.

See [`security.md`](./docs/security.md) for tips on using `openai/codex-action` securely.

## Safety Strategy

The `safety-strategy` input determines how much access Codex receives on the runner. Choosing the right option is critical, especially when sensitive secrets (like your OpenAI API key) are present.

See [Protecting your `OPENAI_API_KEY`](./docs/security.md#protecting-your-openai_api_key) on the Security page for important details on this topic.

- **`drop-sudo` (default)** — On Linux and macOS runners, the action revokes the default user’s `sudo` membership before invoking Codex. Codex then runs as that user without superuser privileges. This change lasts for the rest of the job, so subsequent steps cannot rely on `sudo`. This is usually the safest choice on GitHub-hosted runners.
- **`unprivileged-user`** — Runs Codex as the user provided via `codex-user`. Use this if you manage your own runner with a pre-created unprivileged account. Ensure the user can read the repository checkout and any files Codex needs. See [`unprivileged-user.yml`](./examples/unprivileged-user.yml) for an example of how to configure such an account on `ubuntu-latest`.
- **`read-only`** — Executes Codex in a read-only sandbox. Codex can view files but cannot mutate the filesystem or access the network directly. The OpenAI API key still flows through the proxy, so Codex could read it if it can reach process memory.
- **`unsafe`** — No privilege reduction. Codex runs as the default `runner` user (which typically has `sudo`). Only use this when you fully trust the prompt. On Windows runners this is the only supported choice and the action will fail if another option is provided.

### Operating system support

- **Windows**: GitHub-hosted Windows runners lack a supported sandbox. Set `safety-strategy: unsafe`. The action validates this and exits early otherwise.
- **Linux/macOS**: All options for `safety-strategy` are supported. Again, if you pick `drop-sudo`, remember that later steps in your `job` that rely on `sudo` will fail. If you do need to run code that requires `sudo` after `openai/codex-action` has run, one option is to pipe the output of `openai/codex-action` to a fresh `job` on a new host and to continue your workflow from there.

## Outputs

| Name            | Description                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `final-message` | Final message returned by `codex exec`. |

As we saw in the example above, we took the `final-message` output of the `run_codex` step and made it an output of the `codex` job in the workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  codex:
    # ...
    outputs:
      final_message: ${{ steps.run_codex.outputs.final-message }}
```

## Additional tips

- Run this action after `actions/checkout@v5` so Codex has access to your repository contents.
- To use a non-default Responses endpoint (for example Azure OpenAI), set `responses-api-endpoint` to the provider's URL while keeping `openai-api-key` populated; the proxy will still send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` upstream.
- If you want Codex to have access to a narrow set of privileged functionality, consider running a local MCP server that can perform these actions and configure Codex to use it.
- If you need more control over the CLI invocation, pass flags through `codex-args` or create a `config.toml` in `codex-home`.
- Once `openai/codex-action` is run once with `openai-api-key`, you can also call `codex` from subsequent scripts in your job. (You can omit `prompt` and `prompt-file` from the action in this case.)

## Azure

To configure the Action to use OpenAI models hosted on Azure, pay close attention to the following:

- The `responses-api-endpoint` must be set to the full URL (including any required query parameters) that Codex will `POST` to for a Responses API request. For Azure, this might look like `https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/responses`. Note that [unlike when customizing a model provider in Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/config.md#azure-model-provider-example), you must include the `v1/responses` suffix to the URL yourself, if appropriate.
- The `openai-api-key` input must be a valid key that can be used with the `Authorization: Bearer <KEY>` header when making a `POST` request to your Responses API endpoint. (This is also true for the value of the [`env_key`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/config.md#azure-model-provider-example) when setting a custom provider using the Codex CLI.)

Ultimately, your configured Action might look something like the following:

```yaml
- name: Start Codex proxy
  uses: openai/codex-action@v1
  with:
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    responses-api-endpoint: "https://bolinfest-7804-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1/responses"
    prompt: "Debug all the things."
```

### Using ChatGPT subscription auth

If you already have a Codex login on a developer machine, you can export your CLI credentials and provide them to this action via a base64-encoded `auth.json`:

1. On a trusted machine where `codex` is logged in, find `auth.json` under `~/.codex/auth.json`.
2. Base64-encode it and save into a GitHub secret:

   Linux/macOS:

   ```bash
   base64 -w0 ~/.codex/auth.json
   ```

   macOS (BSD base64):

   ```bash
   base64 -i ~/.codex/auth.json | tr -d '\n'
   ```

3. In your workflow, pass the secret to the action:

```yaml
- uses: openai/codex-action@v1
  with:
    codex-auth-json-b64: ${{ secrets.CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64 }}
    prompt: |
      Hello from subscription auth.
```

Notes:
- Do not provide both `openai-api-key` and `codex-auth-json-b64` unless you specifically want to use the Responses API proxy; if both are present, the proxy configuration takes precedence.
- `auth.json` is sensitive. This action writes it with file mode `0600`. Prefer `safety-strategy: drop-sudo` or `unprivileged-user` to limit risk.
